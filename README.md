This project is an Apache httpd module that performs authentication against the NLM VSAC license verification RESTful web service.  It was developed because the Cypress project had a need to restrict access to clinical codeset data to only individuals who had executed a license agreement with the NLM.

This document lists the various configuration options that the module supports and shows how to configure it in apache.
